# Happy Summer!!

This is just to test out the Github pages platform without using a
static site generator.

This is a very simple site that I have up temporarily while I experiment
with different developer tools.

My top 4 repositories I\'m currently developing in are: [(some might be
private)]{.small}
:::

::: container
-   [This one](https://awsomesawce.github.io)
-   [Scripts-Pwsh](https://github.com/awsomesawce/scripts-pwsh) -
    Kickass collection of amazing Powershell utility functions and
    scripts.
-   [My Python
    Scripts](https://github.com/awsomesawce/my-python-scripts) My
    experimental python script repository for testing out various stdlib
    modules and popular `pip` modules like
    [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
-   [My dotfiles repo](https://github.com/awsomesawce/my-dotfiles),
    which is just a collection of my dotfiles I use in Linux/Windows on
    a daily basis. *Constantly* updated and maintained.
-   [mdbook_test](https://github.com/awsomesawce/mdbook_test), which is
    a test of the `MDBook` software available from **Arch Linux**\'s
    official `pacman` repository.
-   [my github profile](https://github.com/awsomesawce)

Be aware this site is under *constant development*. It can and *will*
change over time.

Here is another update directly from MSYS2\'s Emacs on my laptop. They
say **Vim** is the best editor, even better than editors like **Visual
Studio Code**. **Vim** has been around for a long time and is highly
customizable. And so is **Emacs**.

## Command-line working

Basically I\'m practicing working in the command-line. There\'s a ton of
information to consume, and it can be easy to fry your brain, but when I
finally get something to work without anyone holding my hand, the
feeling is great! And Vi/Emacs have a lot more options for moving thru
text without using the mouse.

## Here is the list of Linux-based environments I\'m using and playing around with:

-   MSYS2
-   Cygwin
-   WSL1 and 2
-   And traditional tools like vim, emacs, and others.
-   GNU Nano is a great starter\'s text editor for people new to linux.
    It\'s not as feature-packed and customizable as vim/emacs though.

-   **Arch Linux**: Installed by using
    [ArchWSL](https://github.com/yuk7/ArchWSL). My favorite distro at
    the moment.
-   Ubuntu 20.04
-   Debian Testing

## This site is built by hand {#this-site-is-built-by-hand .animate__animated .animate__fadeInLeft}

And by hand I mean by using HTML and CSS while also using
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com "Bootstrap is awesome"){.linky},
[JQuery](https://code.jquery.com). These dependencies are delivered to
the browser by way of CDN. With **Bootstrap**, you can add really great
web components and put them together however you\'d like.
:::

::: {.col-8 .border}
## As you can see, column 2 is a lot bigger than one and three

That\'s because the class is `"col-8"` and the other ones are
`col-4's`.\

Working on integrating with Jekyll and adding/creating custom themes for
it or a different SSG, like Gatsby or [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

Some goals for this site:

-   Integrate with an SSG. [List of SSGs
    [here](https://staticgen.com).]{.small}
-   Experiment with different layouts and themes using
    [**Themestrapp**](https://themestr.app) and/or other tools.
-   Learn **Vim and/or Emacs**
-   Learn how to incorporate one of the many [Javascript Web
    Frameworks](https://colorlib.com/wp/javascript-frameworks/#:~:text=23%20Best%20Free%20JavaScript%20Frameworks%20for%20Web%20Developers,Mithril.%209%20Vue.js.%2010%20Angular.js.%20More%20items...%20)
:::

::: {.col-4 .border .rounded}
Content can be *styled* by simply using Bootstrap CSS classes which
integrate JQuery in producing certain effects like collapsing content,
buttons that do different stuff, responsive nav bars, and all sorts of
stuff like that.
:::

::: {.col-md-8 .border .rounded}
I have been spending a lot of time learning about **Yarn** and **NPM**
and other technologies and frameworks that make it easy for the
developer to add great functionality and user experience to their site.\

**dependencies** in this site.]{.lead .text-info .animate__delay-3s

## What have I been working on?

I\'m currently writing about my experience as an aspiring web developer.
I\'ve written it all inside **VSCodium** into an `HTML` file using my
**webdev expertise** to format it and make it look nice.

Using **Bootstrap** of course.

My latest venture has been into the world of
**[Hugo](https://gohugo.io)** SSG and using the `golang` compiler to
build the site. Today I have also been experimenting with building sites
using node.js frameworks like `create-react-app` and the
`bootstrap-npm-starter` which you can find [here](http://)

Also,
[react-webpack-starter](https://github.com/ulises-jeremias/react-webpack-starter)
didn\'t work for me, but of course there are tons of different packages
to explore.

Sometimes I\'ll make the mistake of cloning the repository instead of
using npm to install it. But then I found out that all I have to do is
run the command `npm install` inside the directory and it will then
install all the dependencies needed to run the development server and
other things.

I will implement those technologies into this repository in due time.
There are a ton of great packages of software out there that do a bunch
of different things.

Right now, with this site, I just use the tools and packages available
in my [**editor of choice**.](http://vscodium.org)

Here is a screenshot of me using **Chrome DevTools** to inspect it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

essay/writing](img/screenshot_develop.jpg){.img-fluid}

Next I want to write about all the awesome extensions I use in
[VSCodium](https://vscodium.com){.font-weight-bold} as a beginner
developer. I have access to some great functions that allow for an
easier development experience. Things like **CSS Peek** and **HTML CSS
Support** add to the already feature-packed HTML/CSS extensions built
into [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

Also FYI for people who don\'t know,
[VSCodium](https://vscodium.com){.font-weight-bold} is simply a build of
the **Open Source** code without the weight of the *Microsoft License*
attached to it. And I just like to support **Open Source** in general.
