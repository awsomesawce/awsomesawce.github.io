<p>This is just to test out the Github pages platform without using a static site generator.</p>
<p>This is a very simple site that I have up temporarily while I experiment with different developer tools.</p>
<p>My top 4 repositories I'm currently developing in are: <span class="small">(some might be private)</span></p>

<ul>

<p>Here is another update directly from MSYS2's Emacs on my laptop. They say <strong>Vim</strong> is the best editor, even better than editors like <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong>. <strong>Vim</strong> has been around for a long time and is highly customizable. And so is <strong>Emacs</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="command-line-working">Command-line working</h2>
<p>Basically I'm practicing working in the command-line. There's a ton of information to consume, and it can be easy to fry your brain, but when I finally get something to work without anyone holding my hand, the feeling is great! And Vi/Emacs have a lot more options for moving thru text without using the mouse.</p>
<h2 id="here-is-the-list-of-linux-based-environments-im-using-and-playing-around-with">Here is the list of Linux-based environments I'm using and playing around with:</h2>
<ul>
<li>MSYS2</li>
<li>Cygwin</li>
<li>WSL1 and 2</li>
<li>And traditional tools like vim, emacs, and others.</li>
<li>GNU Nano is a great starter's text editor for people new to linux. It's not as feature-packed and customizable as vim/emacs though.</li>

<p>Working on integrating with Jekyll and adding/creating custom themes for it or a different SSG, like Gatsby or <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>.</p>
<p>Some goals for this site:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integrate with an SSG. <span class="small">List of SSGs <a href="https://staticgen.com">here</a>.</span></li>
<li>Experiment with different layouts and themes using <a href="https://themestr.app"><strong>Themestrapp</strong></a> and/or other tools.</li>
<li>Learn <strong>Vim and/or Emacs</strong></li>
<li>Learn how to incorporate one of the many <a href="https://colorlib.com/wp/javascript-frameworks/#:~:text=23%20Best%20Free%20JavaScript%20Frameworks%20for%20Web%20Developers,Mithril.%209%20Vue.js.%2010%20Angular.js.%20More%20items...%20">Javascript Web Frameworks</a></li>

<p>Content can be <em>styled</em> by simply using Bootstrap CSS classes which integrate JQuery in producing certain effects like collapsing content, buttons that do different stuff, responsive nav bars, and all sorts of stuff like that.</p>

<h2>What have I been working on?</h2>
<p>I'm currently writing about my experience as an aspiring web developer. I've written it all inside <strong>VSCodium</strong> into an <code>HTML</code> file using my <strong>webdev expertise</strong> to format it and make it look nice.</p>
<p>Using <strong>Bootstrap</strong> of course.</p>
<p>My latest venture has been into the world of <strong><a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a></strong> SSG and using the <code>golang</code> compiler to build the site. Today I have also been experimenting with building sites using node.js frameworks like <code>create-react-app</code> and the <code>bootstrap-npm-starter</code> which you can find <a href="http://">here</a></p>
<p>Also, <a href="https://github.com/ulises-jeremias/react-webpack-starter">react-webpack-starter</a> didn't work for me, but of course there are tons of different packages to explore.</p>
<p>Sometimes I'll make the mistake of cloning the repository instead of using npm to install it. But then I found out that all I have to do is run the command <code>npm install</code> inside the directory and it will then install all the dependencies needed to run the development server and other things.</p>
<p>I will implement those technologies into this repository in due time. There are a ton of great packages of software out there that do a bunch of different things.</p>
<p>Right now, with this site, I just use the tools and packages available in my <a href="http://vscodium.org"><strong>editor of choice</strong>.</a></p>
<p>Here is a screenshot of me using <strong>Chrome DevTools</strong> to inspect it.</p>

</figure>
<hr />
<p>Next I want to write about all the awesome extensions I use in <a href="https://vscodium.com" class="font-weight-bold">VSCodium</a> as a beginner developer. I have access to some great functions that allow for an easier development experience. Things like <strong>CSS Peek</strong> and <strong>HTML CSS Support</strong> add to the already feature-packed HTML/CSS extensions built into <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code</a>.</p>
<p>Also FYI for people who don't know, <a href="https://vscodium.com" class="font-weight-bold">VSCodium</a> is simply a build of the <strong>Open Source</strong> code without the weight of the <em>Microsoft License</em> attached to it. And I just like to support <strong>Open Source</strong> in general.</p>
