# TODO for Awsomesawce.github.io

Lots of things to clean up here.  Simpler is better.

A lot of times I will try and do something new and it just ends up over-complicating the problem.

I just need a consise site that shows what I'm working on, and that's it.

## Options

1. Just start over from scratch.

2. Reorganize pages and files so that it fits a more traditional project file-structure.

  - This includes putting all pages besides `./index.html` in their own "pages" directory.

3. Use a static-site generator like _Hugo_ or _MDBook_ to render `markdown` files into a full site.

  - Both programs do a good job and both are fast.  I'd say from experience that **Hugo** seems a bit faster.
