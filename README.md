## Welcome to my GitHub Pages site!

This is a test project.  Currently I am hand-writing each page and each post.  I'm **not** using *any* framework at this time.  Although I have been experimenting with **Hugo** and some different **npm** packages and dependencies.  I like **Hugo** because it's extremely fast, but I still need to learn more.  

## Past attempts at incorporating an **npm** dependency or two

I've tried the official **bootstrap-npm-starter** and I haven't gotten the hang of it yet.  Tbh I felt more comfortable using **Hugo** even though it required installing the `go runtime`.

## Current Global Yarn executables
I have installed some **Yarn** global executables.
* nodemon
* angular-cli
* serve
* lessc - a global executable to convert `less` files into `.css` files
* sass - a global executable to convert `.scss` or `.sass` files into `.css` files

## To-do

- [ ] Implement some sort of framework, whether it be `npx`, `hugo`, `hexo`, or `jekyll`, or even `gatsby`
- [ ] Create posts directory
- [ ] Use `html imports` to import components you use often, like <b>navbars</b>
