**Important**: Make sure to `git push` from the same os file system.  If cloned into windows, use `git push` from windows command-line.  If you mix the os's you might commit twice unknowingly.
> If the `git status` comes back with a clean working directory, `git status` from linux will say that everything is untracked.  This might be because `unix/linux` recognizes git repos differently.


## Welcome to my GitHub Pages site!

This is a test project.  Currently I am hand-writing each page and each post.  I'm **not** using *any* framework at this time.  Although I have been experimenting with **Hugo** and some different **npm** packages and dependencies.  I like **Hugo** because it's extremely fast, but I still need to learn more.  

## Current Global Yarn executables
I have installed some **Yarn** global executables.
* nodemon
* angular-cli
* serve
* lessc - a global executable to convert `less` files into `.css` files
* sass - a global executable to convert `.scss` or `.sass` files into `.css` files

## To-do

- [ ] Implement some sort of framework, whether it be `npx`, `hugo`, `hexo`, or `jekyll`, or even `gatsby`
- [x] Create posts directory
- [ ] Use `html imports` to import components you use often, like <b>navbars</b>
