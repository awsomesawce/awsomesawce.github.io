<body><h1>Testing new programs and text editors</h1>
<p>This will be where I take notes about the new editors and programs I&#39;ve been introduced to.</p>
<h2>What I look for in a text editor</h2>
<pre><code>- Easy-to-use 
- Customizability
- Unambiguous
- Ergonomic
- Various features out of the box
	- A plugin system
	- Integration with popular programming languages and frameworks
	- A theme system
- Integration with git
- Nice-looking UI
	- Layers, Toolbars, sidebar, bottom - for output, optional integrated terminal

- Markdown support out-of-the-box
- Emacs and Vim optional keymaps
- FAST STARTUP
</code></pre>
<p>I&#39;m planning on writing a whole review on the experience I&#39;ve had with various text editors available on both Windows and Linux.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a huge list of text editors out there and it&#39;s nice to know which ones are good and which ones are not worth using.</p>
<h2>WSL and Linux-flavored text editors.</h2>
<p>There are more text editors on <em>Linux</em> than there are in <em>Windows</em>, and a lot of the ones in <em>Windows</em> are ports of ones from <em>Linux</em> (eg. Vim and Emacs).  Here are a list of the text editors, particularily the ones I&#39;ve used on the command line.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vim</strong> - This is the one to learn if you want to be fast as hell.  It&#39;s a <em>modal</em> editor, meaning you have to be in certain modes to accomplish certain tasks.  This in effect increases the amount of keybindings you have to learn, because there are different bindings for each mode (Normal, Insert, and Visual).</li>
<li><strong>GNU Emacs</strong>- Has an amazingly extended amount of plugins available that transform it into a whole bunch of different types of software, including a full-fledged note app, a calendar, a web browser, an X window manager(!!), etc.</li>
<li>JOE (Joe&#39;s Own Editor) - An editor by some dude named &quot;Joe&quot; who tries to incorporate the best of <em>Vim</em> with the best of <em>Emacs</em>, and also <em>Pico</em> and others.</li>
<li>GNU Nano - The editor for linux newbs, besides Micro and maybe Tilde.  This one&#39;s pretty decent too but is not as extensible and configurable than the top two in this list.  This is a great starting point for people new to the linux platform or command-line.  Available cross platform.</li>

</ul>
<p>Actually right now it&#39;s important to note that all of the above editors have cross-platform binaries available.  So these are available to try out on Windows or Mac even if you don&#39;t have a linux command-line available.</p>
<p><strong>Micro</strong> - this is on the same level as GNU Nano but comes right out-of-the-box with keybindings similar to regular <em>Windows</em> apps.  The standard ones apply like <code>Ctrl-S</code> for Save, <code>Ctrl-Q</code> for quit, <code>Ctrl-V</code> for paste, etc.</p>
<p>The other ones are a bit quirky: Vile (Vile Is Like Emacs), Jed, Vis (a Vim-like app that claims to be more intuitive than Vim).</p>
<h2>In conclusion</h2>
<p>Although it&#39;s fun to play around with the different command-line editors available in linux, newbies should devote their time learning one of the two main ones (Vi or Emacs) and get a real hang on one of those because once you get familiar with the keymap, you can just zoom around like a real hacker!</p>
