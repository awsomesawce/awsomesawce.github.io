      <p class="lead">There is too much to learn!
      </p>
      <p class="text-body text">As an aspiring web developer, I am anxious to learn all the intricacies of the processes of developing on the web.  This attitude towards absorbing all the information can lead to information overload.  There are way too many different ways to get your content out on the web.  Technologies from the past, present, and future (beta, experimental).  These all need to be learned and absorbed into anyone who's aspiring to know what goes on in front-end and back-end development.</p>
      <p>The problem is people are constantly coming out with new technologies and services that make it easier for the developer to develop.  But the sheer amount of these services is uncanny.</p>
      <p>I remember back in the day when <code>PHP</code> was the definitive server-side language to learn if you want to develop an interactive experience on the web.  But as the tech developed over time, now it's possible to do it all by using <b>Javascript</b> and <code>Node.js</code>!  This rendered <b>PHP</b> obsolete in a lot of developer's eyes.</p>
      <p class="lead text-success">The new way of development on the web is labeled as <b>Jamstack</b>.</p>
      <p class="text-center text-primary"><b>Jamstack</b> stands for <b>Javascript, APIs, and Markup</b>.</p>
      <p>Javascript workflows nowadays consist of building collections of components, and CSS workflows have followed suit.  This has made development of gerat UX's something that every developer can do with the ongoing support of modules distributed over package managers like <span class="text-primary font-weight-bold">npm</span> and <span class="text-primary font-weight-bold">Yarn</span> and even <span class="text-primary font-weight-bold">Chocolatey</span></p>
