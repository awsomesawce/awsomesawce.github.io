<h1 id="what-ive-been-working-on">What I’ve been working on</h1>
<p>I’m currently studying for the <strong>OpenJS</strong> <em>JSNSD</em> and <em>JSNAD</em> certificates. Link <a href="https://openjsf.org/certification/">here</a></p>
<p>The courses and certification tests are hosted thru <a href="https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/jsnsd/">The Linux Foundation</a></p>
<p>I am using <abbr title="Windows Subsystem for Linux">WSL</abbr> distros like <a href="https://ubuntu.com/wsl">Ubuntu</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/debian/9msvkqc78pk6">Debian</a> with <strong>NodeJS</strong> installed using <code>nvm</code>. You can get <code>nvm</code> <a href="https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm">here</a>.</p>
<p>My <strong>GitHub</strong> account is <a href="https://github.com/awsomesawce">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="latest-projects">Latest projects</h2>
<p>I currently have my <code>dotfiles</code> saved to a private git repo which allows me to keep track of the changes I make to various configuration files (<code>.bashrc</code>, <code>.zshrc</code>, <code>.infokey</code>, <code>.vimrc</code>). This also allows me to port them into whichever distro or development environment I want.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/awsomesawce/scripts-pwsh">Here</a> is where I’m experimenting with all <strong>Powershell</strong> has to offer.</p>
<p>You can find more information about Microsoft’s <strong>Powershell</strong> <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/">here</a></p>
<p>I currently have version 7.1.0 of <strong>Powershell Core</strong> installed on my system.</p>
<p>I’ve been playing around with all the different shells available for the <strong>Linux</strong> environment, including <code>zsh</code> (The Z Shell), <code>bash</code> (GNU Bourne Again Shell), <code>fish</code> (Friendly Interactive Shell), and others.</p>
<p>For <strong>NodeJS</strong>, the preferred environment for development is thru Linux, and the preferred way to install is by using <code>nvm</code> as described above.</p>
<h2 id="learning-the-linux-file-system">Learning the Linux file system</h2>
<p>I’ve been having a blast learning how linux works under the hood. There are a ton of different commands and executables availalbe as well as shell scripting that makes <em>automation</em> a breeze!</p>
<h2 id="editors-im-experimenting-with">Editors I’m experimenting with</h2>
<p>Currently I’m using <strong>Emacs</strong> with the <em>Evil</em> (Extensible Vi Layer) package. This allows me to use the best of both <strong>Vim</strong> and <strong>Emacs</strong> in one program.</p>
<h3 id="comparing-emacs-and-vim">Comparing Emacs and Vim</h3>
<p>The two most used editors in the Linux world are <strong>Emacs</strong> and <strong>Vim</strong>. Both have their pros and cons. This is why I like using <em>Evil</em> <strong>Emacs</strong> because it retains the <em>finger-feel</em> of <strong>Vim</strong> but the extensibility of <strong>Emacs</strong>.</p>
