# List of programs and projects I'm currently working with.

# Testing new programs and text editors
This will be where I take notes about the new editors and programs I've been introduced to.
## What I look for in a text editor
	- Easy-to-use 
	- Customizability
	- Unambiguous
	- Ergonomic
	- Various features out of the box
		- A plugin system
		- Integration with popular programming languages and frameworks
		- A theme system
	- Integration with git
	- Nice-looking UI
		- Layers, Toolbars, sidebar, bottom - for output, optional integrated terminal
	
	- Markdown support out-of-the-box
	- Emacs and Vim optional keymaps
	- FAST STARTUP
	


## Windows
### CudaText
A new FOSS editor with themes, plugins, low footprint, fast startup time.
The bottom has an integrated python console.  I wonder if it works with other things.
#### To find out

### Spacemacs

### FVim 

## Dual-Operating system

### Micro

### Vim

## Linux Only

### Jed
