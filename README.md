**Important**: Make sure to `git push` from the same os file system.  If cloned into windows, use `git push` from windows command-line.  If you mix the os's you might commit twice unknowingly.
> If the `git status` comes back with a clean working directory, `git status` from linux will say that everything is untracked.  This might be because `unix/linux` recognizes git repos differently.

> Updates coming soon!
